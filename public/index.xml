      <description>Omega Group plc- Pay DiscriminationAt the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women.</description>

      <description>Madhur AgarwalWhen I joined my undergraduate program, I weighed 274 pounds. I got rejected from the university Cricket team because I was too overweight. My target was to play for the team. The next day I started my weight loss journey. On day one, I could barely run 100 meters. By the third day, I had pain in every single body part. But I did not give up. By the fourth month I was running 10 Kms a day.</description>

      <description>GDP components over time and among countriesTo look at the differences in GDP across countries, we have focussed on Germany, India, and USA. In order to gain a better understanding of their components and trends, we have sorted, cleaned, and filtered the data before plotting the relevant data points in the charts that follow:
UN_GDP_data &amp;lt;- read_excel(here::here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls&amp;quot;), # Excel filenamesheet=&amp;quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr&amp;quot;, # Sheet nameskip=2) # Number of rows to skipTo make the data easier to handle, we have changed the figures, renamed the indicators and pivoted the data.</description>

      <description>IMDB ratings: Differences between directorsExamining the IMDB rating and focusing on the mean ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, we initially reproduced the given plot before doing further calculations to determine the validity of the comparison.
Reproducing the graph and running hypothesis tests on the differences between ratings of Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton:
Our null and alternate hypotheses are:
H0: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is equal to zeroH1: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is not equal to zero</description>

      <description>Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversionEvery so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the “inverted yield curve” and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a inverted yield curve is can be found here. If you’d rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from NPR on yield curve indicators

      <description>Let me take you 5 years back , January 2015. As the sun came down and the clock hit 5 , one could easily feel the chill in the air . Every evening I knew the next one, one and a half hour are going to be fun and relieve me of the daylong boredom from the monotonous college lectures.
There was this kid named Praveen, there was something different about him .</description>
