      <description>GDP components over time and among countriesTo look at the differences in GDP accross countries, we have focussed on Germany, India, and USA. In order to gain a better understanding of their components and trends, we have sorted, cleaned, and filtered the data before plotting the relevant data points in the charts that follow:
UN_GDP_data &amp;lt;- read_excel(here::here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls&amp;quot;), # Excel filenamesheet=&amp;quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr&amp;quot;, # Sheet nameskip=2) # Number of rows to skipTo make the data easier to handle, we have changed the figures, renamed the indicators and pivoted the data.</description>
