title: With him I have a story
---
Let me take you 5 years back , January 2015. As the sun came down and the clock hit 5 , one could easily feel the chill  in the air . Every evening I knew the next one, one and a half hour are going to be fun and relieve me of the daylong boredom from the monotonous college lectures. 

There was this kid named Praveen, there was something different about him . He was in the first standard. He was like a whiz kid among the kids that used to come to study. (It goes like this that I was a part of "Pratigya"" society of my college that teaches the underprivileged children ) There was always this charm on his face and he had a very positive attitude towards things. He belonged to a very poor family but he was very enthusiastic about learning anything that he could get. We had a great bonding . While everyone else was learning maths,  I knew he was good with it ,so we started working on his English speaking .One day I remember my phone rang and he saw the name on the screen and he asked me “ Was that your GF’s call?”, and there was this teasing smile on his face and I was like ”wow man ! You have  started phrasing sentences on your own”. So yes he was the reason for my happy evenings for the next six months .He even made  a birthday card  for me, so that was cute.  After that, we had our summer break . When I returned he stopped coming ,that was a setback and yes I still at times feel sad about it . Sometimes I sit and think that on one side is that kid who lives so happily, can have so positive approach towards life  even when life has been hard to him  , on the other side, there are people like us, I mean like many of us who get upset, angry and frustrated with the petty problems in our life .

So what I feel is that rather than getting mad at people , cursing life for the situations it puts us in , we at times need to let things go and need to look to work on the positives! I still remember his voice , the way he would say ,Madhur sir.
